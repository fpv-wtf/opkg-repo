# FPV.WTF OPKG Repository
> Custom OPKG repository for the FPV.WTF project.

This is the official reposiotry from which the [WTFOS configurator](https://github.com/fpv-wtf/wtfos-configurator) pulls its packages.

## Usage
Add the following entry to your `opkg.conf`:

```
src/gz fpv.wtf http://repo.fpv.wtf/pigeon
```

Update `opkg` and list packages from repository:

```
opkg update
```

### Pre-releases
If you want to use pre-release packages then add the pre-release repository **instead** of the stable one from above to `opkg.conf`:

```
src/gz fpv.wtf http://repo.fpv.wtf/pigeon-prerelease
```

The prerelease repository contains pre-release packages when available, otherwise the stable packe is available.

> Only use either the stable repository or the pre-release repository.

### Submitting a Pull Request
Your bugfixes and improvements are always welcome. If you are unsure about a new feature, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/fpv-wtf/opkg-repo/issues/new) for discussion.

When submitting your PR, please submit it against the **develop** branch of this repository.

### Adding your package
Fork the repository and add your Github project to `repositories.json`, then [submit a PR](#submitting-a-pull-request). The package index will be rebuilt and your packages will be automatically added once your PR has been merged into master.

Each entry consists of two fields:

```
{
  "repo": "user/repo-name",
  "names": [
    "name_1",
    "name_2",
  ]
}
```

* **repo**: Github repository name
* **names**: An array of package names. This name is the first part of the actual filename of your ipk package but has also to match the `Package` field in your control file.

> Example: If your package is called `foobar`, then the ipk in your release should be called `foobar_$VERSION_$ARCH.ipk` and the names array should only contain one entry: `foobar`.

Once the deployment runs it will check the latest release of your project, fetch all matching `ipk` files and check the control file:

1. fetch `name_1*.ipk` and `name_2*.ipk`
2. Check if the Package field matches in each of the ipk's

If everything checks out a new index is build.
Otherwise the build fails and the offending package will be visible in the build logs.

### Package naming
We ask that you give your packages a short, simple and descriptive name. Some examples include:
 - `live-audio` - for live audio on the v1 goggles and an au
 - `auto-record` - for automatically starting recording when air side is connected
 - `avin-mods` - for a package containing mulitple avin related tweaks

 Please do not tag packages with the `wtfos-` prefix without consulting with the team first, as it's reserved for core packages. Please also don't tag packages with the author/group name, use the Maintainer .ipk control field instead. This will be shown soon in the configurator (as of time of writing).

### Licensing
Please make sure that the package you are submitting has an open source license attached to it (preferably GPL V3). Pull Requests for packages without a license (or a too restrictive licence) will be rejected.

You can - at any point - run your own repository though (this code is GPL V3) if you are not happy with the licencing term. If you decide to do so make sure that you have some way of supporting your users, since there will be no official support for third party repositories.

### Available architectures
To limit the systems on which your package can be installed, add one of the architectures (from general to specific):

* `pigeon-all`
* `pigeon-glasses` (v1 & v2)
* `pigeon-glasses-v1` or `pigeon-glasses-v2`
* `pigeon-airside` (OG and Lite)
* `pigeon-airside-au` or `pigeon-airside-lite`

### IPK template
You can check out the [IPK example](https://github.com/stylesuxx/ipk-example) repository. It provides a template in regards to folder structure, a `Makefile` and a workflow to automatically build IPK packages via Github Actions.
